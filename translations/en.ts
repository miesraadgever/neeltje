    caption: "I offer two types of classes: pattern drafting and 'free expression'. You sign up for one of the two options.",
    caption1: "In both classes, we create clothing (or other items) using the sewing machine, overlock machine, or by hand; the only difference lies in the approach.",
    caption2:"In the classes, I work with small groups of up to 4 people. This way, I can provide attention to everyone and offer a lot of personal guidance.",
    title1: "Pattern Drafting class",
    title2 : "Free Expression class",
    patroon: "In the Pattern Drafting class, the starting point is learning to draw patterns from scratch, tailored to your own measurements.",
    patroon1:"We start by drafting patterns for the skirt and/or trousers, and then move on to drafting the top. Once you've completed these, you'll have a solid foundation to develop your own designs.",
    patroon2:"This class follows a traditional approach to clothing making, focusing on teaching you the necessary techniques. I will provide some instruction to the class as a whole, after which everyone can continue working on their own projects at their own pace",
    vrij: "In the Free Expression class, you're encouraged to bring along projects you want to work on. Think of projects you might have lying around at home or clothes that are too big for you.",
    vrij1: "For example, we can do alterations to ensure that the garment fits perfectly to your body and preferences.",
    vrij2: "Another project example: I've designed a skirt myself, which consists entirely of lace patches. I did this without a pattern, by pinning and shaping the patches on myself until I was satisfied with the design.",
    vrij3: "This class is great if you want to take a more experimental approach to the clothing-making process.",
    taal: "English speakers are very welcome!",
